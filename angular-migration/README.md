## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm 9+
- Angular CLI 16+

### Installation Steps

1. **Navigate to the Angular migration directory:**
   ```bash
   cd angular-migration
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   ng serve
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:4200
   ```

## 🔧 Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm test` - Run unit tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run e2e` - Run end-to-end tests

## 🎨 Architecture Overview

### Standalone Components
All components are built using Angular 16's standalone component architecture:
- No NgModules required
- Direct imports in component decorators
- Tree-shakable by default
- Simplified testing

### Services
- **DesignerService**: Manages canvas operations, objects, and designer state
- **AuthService**: Handles user authentication and session management  
- **ThemeService**: Manages application themes and styling

### State Management
- RxJS Observables for reactive state management
- BehaviorSubjects for shared state
- Proper subscription management with takeUntil pattern

## 🎯 Key Components

### Designer Component
The main canvas area where users create dashboards:
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Object selection and manipulation
- Zoom and pan controls

## 🔄 Migration from AngularJS

This project represents a complete rewrite from AngularJS 1.x to Angular 16:

### What was migrated:
- ✅ All controllers converted to Angular components
- ✅ Services modernized with dependency injection
- ✅ Templates updated to Angular syntax
- ✅ Routing migrated to Angular Router
- ✅ HTTP calls updated to HttpClient
- ✅ Testing migrated from Jasmine/Karma to Jest

### Modern Angular patterns:
- ✅ Standalone components
- ✅ Reactive forms
- ✅ RxJS observables
- ✅ Angular Material UI
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode
- ✅ Modern build tooling

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

- Legacy browser support (IE11) not included
- Some third-party integrations may need updates
- Custom color picker implementation needed (Angular Material doesn't include one)
